description = Entities cover mathematical and statistical content in instructional text. Tag only domain‑specific spans that match the label definitions below; examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. Copy entity text exactly as it appears (hyphenation, spacing, casing). Do NOT tag symbolic variables or parameters (e.g., x, y, β, μ, θ, w), numeric literals, punctuation, nor generic words/phrases (e.g., “loss”, “probability”, “update”, “matrix”) unless they are part of a named term. Prefer the most specific label when multiple could apply. Tie‑breakers: if a term names a function (e.g., “softmax”, “indicator function”, “cross‑entropy loss”), use FUNCTION rather than OPERATOR; “gradient descent” is ALGORITHM, while “derivative”, “argmax” are OPERATOR; “learning rate” is a CONCEPT (hyperparameter).

[components.llm.task.label_definitions]
ALGORITHM = "Named computational procedures or learning methods (e.g. LDA, logistic regression, neural networks)."
CONCEPT = "Abstract mathematical/statistical ideas (e.g. linear classifier, posterior probability, decision boundary, prior, covariance matrix)."
THEOREM_RULE = "Named rule or theorem (e.g. Bayes' rule)."
DISTRIBUTION = "Named probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian distribution)."
FUNCTION = "Specific named functions (e.g. logistic sigmoid function, exponential when referred to as a function)."
OPERATOR = "Named operators (e.g. argmax, sign)."
