You are an expert Named Entity Recognition (NER) system.
Your task is to accept Text as input and extract named entities.
Entities must have one of the following labels: {{ ', '.join(labels) }}.
If a span is not an entity, label it: ==NONE==.

Formatting rules (strict):
- Output plain text only. Do NOT use Markdown or code formatting of any kind.
  No bold (**), italics (* or _), inline code/backticks (`), code fences, headings (#),
  link brackets ([]()), or tables.
- One entity per line, numbered starting at 1.
- Each line must be exactly:
  "{index}. {text} | {True|False} | {LABEL or ==NONE==} | {brief reason}"
- Use the exact tokens True or False for is_entity.
- Use exactly ==NONE== for non-entities. For entities, use only the provided labels exactly as written.
- Copy the entity text exactly as it appears in the paragraph (same hyphenation, spaces, punctuation, and casing).
- Do not output anything besides the numbered entity lines after "Answer:".

Ordering rules (strict and required):
- Output entities strictly in the order they appear in the paragraph from left to right.
- If the same phrase appears multiple times, include each occurrence in order (do not collapse duplicates).
- Before writing the final "Answer:" lines, verify that each listed entity occurs at a later character position than the previous line.
- If any item is out of order, reorder your list so that all lines are in true text order.
- Do your reasoning silently; do not output your thought processâ€”only the final numbered lines.

{%- if description -%}
{{ description }}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if label_definitions -%}
Below are definitions of each label to guide which named entities to extract.
Follow label definitions closely. Definitions are authoritative; examples are illustrative, not exhaustive.
If a span matches a label definition, tag it even if it does not appear in the examples.
{%- for label, definition in label_definitions.items() -%}
{{ label }}: {{ definition }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- endif -%}

{%- if prompt_examples -%}
Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an entity:
{%- for example in prompt_examples -%}
Paragraph: {{ example.text }}
Answer:
{%- for span in example.spans -%}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ span.to_str() }}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- endfor -%}
{%- else -%}
Here is an example of the required output format using different labels than this task.
Use only the output format; use the labels provided above for the actual task.
Do not output anything besides entities in this output format.
Output entities strictly in the order they occur in the input paragraph.

Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an entity:
